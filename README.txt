Hi,

The aim of this project is to provide a bash shell clone (not entirely, but with some limited subset of features which is yet to be determined).

The project will be written entirely in Java and have no dependencies to other libraries.

I have begun this merely to keep my brain active while I look for work and as an educational tool for
anyone interested in programming.

Things to do ... as of June 1st, 2011

o Add environment variable substitution
o More commands !
   - ls
   - cd
   - touch
   - mkdir
   - rmdir
   - rm
   - e.t.c
o Execute commands in background thread using Executor if command ends in &
o Provide ps command

and whatever else I can think of.
