Hi,

The aim of this project is to provide a bash shell clone (not entirely, but with some limited subset of features which is yet to be determined).
The project will be written entirely in Java and have no dependencies to other libraries.


I have begun this merely to keep my brain active while I look for work and as an educational tool for
anyone interested in programming.

You need maven to build this project.  To build run, execute this from your *nix command line

$> mvn clean package
$> java -jar target/shell-1.0-SNAPSHOT.jar

You should now have a shell with very basic command support (two commands actually), cls and echo.  Echo supports variable substitution.  Try running echo "$HOME" or echo "$java.version foo bar"
Yeah, I know, big deal, but I'm setting up the plumbing and thinking about how things should work, so implementing basic commands is the best way for me to do this right now.



Things to do ... as of June 1st, 2011


o Add proper prompt support (at a minimum, show the current working directory)

o More commands !
   - ls
   - cd
   - set
   - unset
   - touch
   - mkdir
   - rmdir
   - rm
   - e.t.c

o Execute commands in background thread using Executor if command ends in &

o Provide ps command


and whatever else I can think of.
